/**
 * In SmartACE, we statically resolve contract types, to avoid dynamic dispatch.
 * As a part of this analysis we must know the "true" types of all contract
 * variables, and we must know whether or not a contract return value is given
 * as a reference, or allocated on demand.
 * 
 * This file implements (ad-hoc) flow analysis to determine the flow radius of
 * all new calls. This analysis is conservative.
 * 
 * @todo(scottwe): perhaps we could make this analysis more "rigorous". Right
 *                 now the MiniSol dialect require bundles where the assumptions
 *                 of this analysis are met, so it should be fine for now.
